       <h1>The Industrial Revolution</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
        The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"> Europe</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a>
        , in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines,
        new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes,
        the increasing use of steam power and water power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the mechanized factory system.
        The Industrial Revolution also led to an unprecedented rise in the rate of population growth.
        The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and many of the technological innovations were of British origin.
        By the mid-18th century Britain was the world's leading commercial nation, controlling a global trading empire with colonies in North America and the Caribbean, and with major military and political hegemony on the Indian subcontinent, particularly with the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal, through the activities of the East India Company. The development of trade and the rise of business were among the major causes of the Industrial Revolution.
